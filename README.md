# Atom-Photon-Interface

This repository contains my findings and thesis for my master's project. The main aim of the project was to evaluate if an atom chip developed by an EU-commissioned project called ErBeStA could be coupled to laser light to test if PbS quantum dots could be used as single photon sources in the chip. We had to build our imaging setups for both the dots and the chip, and then integrate the two.
